-Hiya!! I’m @Hoshi-no-Arashi!!
I like stuff like videogames, theyre fun!
Right now I can only code a bit of Javascript and CSS.
I dont relly want to collaborate with anyone for the time being. (Not that id be helpful-the biggest project ive ever done is make an animated soup ad).
How to reach me: Just email Flamberge303@gmail.com! But please mention that youre from Github, otherwise ill probably report it (I got a lot of scam emails recently.)
